# Sydney Train Game Solver

## What are the rules of the Sydney Train Game?

The way I've chosen to define the train game is as follows:
* You are given four integers (the carriage code)
* You may use any bracketing and `+-*/` as you wish
* You must keep the same order
* You must only use each digit once

Can you form an expression that evaluates to 10?

It is solvable approximately 70% of the time.
